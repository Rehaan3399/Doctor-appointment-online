ARCHITECTURE:

 
Frontend Architecture:

The frontend of DocSpot is developed using React.js, chosen for its component-based architecture, reusability, and fast rendering with the Virtual DOM. The design follows a modular structure, ensuring scalability and ease of maintenance. The application is built with Vite for faster development and optimized builds, while Tailwind CSS is used for styling and responsiveness.

1. Component-Based Structure
•	Reusable Components such as Navbar, Footer, Buttons, and Forms ensure consistency across the application.
•	Page Components like Home, Patient Dashboard, Doctor Dashboard, and Admin Panel are separated for better organization.
•	State Management is handled using React’s useState and useContext hooks, while larger states (like authentication or appointments) can use Redux/Context API for global management.

3. Routing
•	Implemented using React Router.
•	Key routes include:
o	/ → Homepage
o	/login & /register → Authentication pages
o	/dashboard/patient → Patient Dashboard
o	/dashboard/doctor → Doctor Dashboard
o	/dashboard/admin → Admin Panel

5. API Integration
•	The frontend communicates with the backend via RESTful APIs.
•	Fetch or Axios is used for API calls (e.g., booking an appointment, fetching doctor details, updating profiles).
•	JWT tokens are stored securely in local storage or cookies for authentication.

6. UI/UX Design
•	Built with responsive layouts (mobile-first design).
•	Tailwind CSS ensures fast, modern, and customizable styling.
•	Accessibility features like form validation, alerts, and dark/light mode improve usability.

8. Frontend Flow
1.	User logs in or registers → Token generated and stored.
2.	Based on role (Patient/Doctor/Admin), different dashboards load.
3.	API requests handle booking, history, availability, and reports.
4.	UI updates dynamically without full-page reloads thanks to React’s SPA (Single Page Application) model.
   
Backend Architecture:

The backend of DocSpot is built using Node.js with the Express.js framework, providing a lightweight, fast, and scalable environment for handling healthcare appointment workflows. The architecture follows the RESTful API design pattern, ensuring clear separation between frontend and backend and easy communication through HTTP requests.

1. Server Layer (Express.js)
•	Express.js acts as the backbone of the backend, handling routing, middleware, and request/response cycles.
•	Each resource (users, doctors, appointments) is mapped to a dedicated API endpoint.
•	Middleware is used for:
o	Authentication & Authorization (JWT tokens)
o	Input Validation (ensuring correct data formats)
o	Error Handling & Logging

3. Controller Layer
•	Contains the business logic of the application.
•	Example:
o	Appointment controller → handles booking, rescheduling, or cancellation.
o	Doctor controller → manages availability and profile updates.
o	User controller → handles registration, login, and authentication.

4. Service Layer
•	Contains reusable functions that interact with the database.
•	Keeps controllers clean by abstracting database queries and transformations.
•	Example: appointmentService.createAppointment() manages appointment creation logic before saving it to the DB.

5. Database Layer
•	MySQL database stores structured data: users, doctors, appointments, and medical history.
•	Sequelize/Knex.js ORM (optional) for simplified query handling and schema management.
•	Relationships:
o	One-to-Many → Doctor ↔ Appointments
o	One-to-Many → Patient ↔ Appointments

6. Security & Authentication
•	JWT-based authentication for session management.
•	Role-based access control (RBAC) to differentiate patient, doctor, and admin privileges.
•	Password encryption (bcrypt.js) for secure user credentials.

7. Scalability & Deployment
•	Backend designed as modular APIs for scalability.
•	Deployed on Heroku/Render/AWS, ensuring availability and performance.
•	Can be extended into microservices architecture if scaled for hospitals with large user bases.

Database Architecture
1.	The database uses MongoDB for flexible, document-oriented storage.
2.	Data is structured to manage patients, doctors, and appointments efficiently.
3.	Relationships like patient–doctor and doctor–appointment are mapped via references.
4.	Mongoose handles schema validation and smooth data interaction.
5.	Indexing ensures fast queries for search and availability checks.
6.	The architecture is scalable, secure, and optimized for healthcare workflows

SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

FOLDER STRACTURE
Client: React Frontend Structure
The client-side of DocSpot is built using React.js, ensuring a modular, scalable, and efficient user interface. The structure follows a component-based architecture, where each UI section (Navbar, Forms, Doctor Cards, etc.) is developed as an independent component. This approach makes the application reusable, maintainable, and easy to debug.
 

Server (Backend) Organization – Node.js with Express.js
The Node.js backend is organized in a clean and modular way to ensure scalability and maintainability. The entry point (server.js) initializes the application, connects it to the MongoDB database, and starts the server. Routes are defined to handle incoming API requests, which are then forwarded to controllers. Controllers contain the business logic and communicate with models, which define the database schema and structure. Middleware and utility files are used for tasks like authentication, validation, and error handling, while services help in managing reusable functionalities. This separation of concerns makes the backend efficient, secure

 

RUNNING THE APPLICATION
To run the application, make sure Node.js and MongoDB are installed and running on your system. First, open the backend folder and run npm install to install dependencies, then start the server using npm start. This will launch the Node.js Express backend on the configured port (default: http://localhost:5000). Next, go to the frontend folder, run npm install, and start the React app with npm run dev. The frontend will usually run on http://localhost:5173 and will connect with the backend API for data. This ensures smooth communication between client, server, and database.
Frontend (React app)
cd client
npm start
Backend (Node.js/Express app)
cd server
npm start

 

API DOCUMENTATION
The backend exposes a set of RESTful APIs that allow smooth communication between the frontend and the database. Each endpoint is designed with a clear purpose, supporting operations such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting data. APIs use HTTP methods like GET for fetching data, POST for inserting new records, PUT for updating existing ones, and DELETE for removing entries. Parameters are passed either through the request body (for sensitive data like login credentials), query strings, or URL paths (for specific resource identification).
Responses are returned in JSON format, containing either the requested data or status messages indicating success or failure. For example, a GET /patients/:id endpoint would return patient details, while a POST /appointments would create a new booking and respond with a confirmation message. Proper error handling ensures that the APIs provide meaningful feedback, such as "User not found" or "Invalid input."
These documented APIs enable the frontend React client to interact seamlessly with the backend, ensuring reliable data flow across users, doctors, and administrators.
 

AUTHENTICATION
In this project, authentication is implemented to verify the identity of users before granting access, while authorization ensures that only users with the correct permissions can perform specific actions. When a user logs in with valid credentials, the backend generates a JSON Web Token (JWT), which is sent back to the client and securely stored. For every request to protected routes, the client must include this token in the request header. The server uses middleware to validate the token and confirm the user’s identity. If valid, access is granted; if not, the request is rejected. Authorization is enforced by assigning roles (such as user, doctor, or admin), where each role has different levels of access to resources. This approach provides a secure, stateless mechanism using tokens instead of traditional session-based logins, ensuring data protection and controlled access throughout the system.

USER INTERFACE
 
TESTING
The testing strategy for this project follows a layered approach to ensure both functionality and reliability:
1.	Unit Testing – Individual functions, components, and modules are tested in isolation. For the backend, tools like Jest or Mocha + Chai are used. On the frontend, React Testing Library verifies component behavior.
2.	Integration Testing – Focuses on testing the interaction between different modules (e.g., API routes with database queries, or frontend forms communicating with backend endpoints).
3.	End-to-End (E2E) Testing – Ensures the entire flow works as expected from the user’s perspective. Cypress or Playwright is used to simulate real user actions (like booking an appointment).
4.	Manual Testing – QA or developers test the app manually for edge cases, UI/UX validation, and exploratory testing.
5.	Automation & CI/CD – Automated test suites are integrated into pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions) so tests run whenever new code is pushed, reducing bugs before deployment.
So, the project uses Jest, React Testing Library, Mocha/Chai, and Cypress as the primary testing tools.
 

KNOWN ISSUES
Despite testing and quality checks, the project currently has a few limitations and bugs that developers and users should be aware of:
1.	Page Refresh on State Loss – Some frontend states (like selected filters or unsaved form data) are lost if the page is refreshed, as persistence is not fully implemented.
2.	Error Handling Gaps – API error messages are sometimes generic (e.g., “Something went wrong”) instead of providing user-friendly feedback.
3.	Mobile Responsiveness – A few UI components may not render perfectly on smaller screens, requiring CSS adjustments.
4.	Slow Initial Load – The first API call (especially when fetching large datasets) may take longer due to the absence of caching.
5.	Authentication Expiry – JWT tokens expire after a set duration, and the app doesn’t always handle auto-refresh gracefully, forcing users to re-login.
 

FEATURES – ENHANCEMENTS
Future Enhancements in this project can include several improvements to increase functionality, scalability, and user experience. Some potential features are:
1.	Advanced Authentication – Integration of OAuth (Google, GitHub) for social login.
2.	Role-Based Access Control – Fine-grained permissions for admin, user, and guest roles.
3.	Scalability – Migration to cloud deployment with Docker and Kubernetes support.
4.	Performance Improvements – Use of caching mechanisms like Redis for faster data retrieval.
5.	UI/UX Enhancements – Adding dark mode, responsive design upgrades, and accessibility improvements.
6.	Notifications System – Real-time email/SMS/push notifications for key events.
7.	Testing Automation – Full integration with CI/CD pipelines and automated test coverage.
8.	Analytics Dashboard – Adding charts and reports for data visualization.
